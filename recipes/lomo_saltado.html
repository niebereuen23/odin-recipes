    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen French fries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 pound beef tri tip, sliced 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced into strips</li>
        <li>3 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and sliced into strips</li>
        <li>1 yellow chili pepper (preferably Peruvian aji amarillo)</li>
        <li>Â¼ cup distilled white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 dash soy sauce to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Arrange frozen French fries in a single layer on an ungreased cookie sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until light golden, 22 to 24 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Season sliced beef with salt and pepper. Cook and stir beef in hot oil until just cooked and the juices release. Use a slotted spoon to transfer beef to a plate.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir onions in beef drippings in the pan until translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Stir in tomato and aji amarillo; cook until tomato softens. Pour in vinegar and soy sauce.</li>
        <li>Add French fries and beef to the pan. Cover and cook until beef is cooked through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve.</li>
    </ol>
